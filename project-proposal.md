# Midterm Project Proposal

### **Research Question:** What is the primary question that you aim to answer in doing this project?

- How do major world events and technological advancements affect the rise and fall of empires?
    - We are interested in whether historical events (both natural and human-made) cause a trend in the maximum size of the empires of their age. Were they bigger or smaller post-world confict? Post pandemic?
    - We also want to see whether technological progress helps or hinders the ability of empires to supersize themselves. Were empires bigger during the Industrial Revolution?
    - Finally, we are interested in whether there was a "golden age" of empires at some point in history.

### **Data:** What data will you collect to answer this question? Where will you get this data from?

- We plan on using the Wikipedia API to collect data from a list of empires. We will collect the name of the empire, the maximum size (in sq km), and the year in which it reached this maximum size, all from [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_empires). This data will be collected programmatically. Once this data has been graphed, we are also interested in manually researching historical events to postulate explanations for clusters of empires during certain time periods.

### **Visuals:** In what way(s) will you present your data? How will these visuals help you to answer the question?

- For one visualization, we plan on using a scatter plot, with year on the _x_ axis and maximum size on the _y_ axis. This plot will allow us to see any potential clusters or correlation in the data.
- We also think it would be interesting to show a timeline of historical events with empire peak points overlaid onto it.
- These visuals will help us relate this data to important points in history, helping us tell a story of the rise and fall of empires.
